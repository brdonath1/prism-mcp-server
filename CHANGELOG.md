# Changelog — PRISM MCP Server

All notable changes to the PRISM MCP server, plus the banner-contract and
framework-template history the server implements. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The banner contract itself
lives in [docs/banner-spec.md](docs/banner-spec.md) — future banner changes
cite that spec and add an entry here.

## [Unreleased] — brief-439 (D-240 Phase B, R8): unified drift-proof banner

### Added
- **Unified banner generator** (`renderUnifiedBanner`, `src/utils/banner.ts`):
  ONE server-side text generator produces `banner_text` for both
  `prism_bootstrap` and `prism_finalize` (commit + full). Boot and finalize
  banners are byte-consistent by construction. Contract: banner spec **3.0**
  ([docs/banner-spec.md](docs/banner-spec.md)).
- **`banner_spec_version` handshake**: every bootstrap/finalize response
  emits `banner_spec_version`; where template content is in hand
  (bootstrap → `core-template-mcp.md`, finalize audit →
  `rules-session-end.md`) the server parses the template's
  `Banner-Spec-Version` declaration, returns it as
  `template_banner_spec_version`, and logs a **`BANNER_DRIFT`** warn
  diagnostic on mismatch. Visibility only — never blocking. Templates that
  declare nothing predate the handshake and produce no diagnostic.
- `prism_finalize action=full` now returns `banner_text` (it previously
  returned no banner at all); its step row carries the real audit/draft
  outcomes.
- `project_display_name` is a top-level bootstrap response field (it
  previously existed only inside the removed `banner_data` object).

### Changed
- **Null-fallback contradiction resolved**: on banner render failure the
  server now emits the Rule 2 single-line fallback
  (`PRISM | Session {N} | Handoff v{V} | {C}/{T} docs`) in `banner_text`
  itself, instead of returning `banner_text: null` plus a structured
  `banner_data` object that contradicted the template's documented fallback.
  Boot adds a `BANNER_RENDER_FALLBACK` warn diagnostic when this happens.
- Bootstrap's template-version parse prefers the explicit
  `Template Version:` declaration so a `Banner-Spec-Version:` line can never
  pollute `template_version`.
- Living-document counting is normalized and unified
  (`countLivingDocumentsUpdated`): the finalize banner's `{C}/{T} docs
  updated` and the commit `confirmation` sentence /
  `living_documents_updated` field now share one counter that handles both
  repo layouts (`.prism/` and legacy root-level — the old HTML banner and
  confirmation both reported `0/10` for unmigrated repos), excludes domain
  decision files (`decisions/{domain}.md` are not living documents), and is
  bounded by the 10-doc total by construction.

### Deprecated
- **HTML finalization widget** (D-46, consumed by Rule 11 Step 6 / D-84):
  `finalization_banner_html` is now **always `null`** — no HTML is generated
  server-side. The field is retained for backward compatibility; Rule 11
  Step 6's documented null path (minimal text confirmation) applies until
  the framework template consumes the finalize `banner_text`
  (chat-side cross-repo follow-up). `banner_html` (bootstrap, null since
  ME-1) and `synthesis_banner_html` (null since D-78) are likewise retained
  as null-only fields.

### Removed
- HTML renderers and helpers deleted from the codebase:
  `renderBannerHtml`, `renderFinalizationBanner`, `escapeHtml`,
  `formatResumptionHtml`, `toolIcon` (~330 lines of HTML/CSS generation).
- `banner_data` bootstrap response field (the QW-1 fallback object) — the
  single-line `banner_text` fallback replaces it. The `banner_data` *input*
  parameter of `prism_finalize` (deliverables / decisions_note /
  step_statuses) is unchanged and honored by the unified generator.

## Banner & Rule-9 history backfill (D-84, D-85)

Logged here per the brief-431 audit (D-240 Phase B): these framework
decisions shaped the banner/response contract this server implements but
were never recorded in any changelog.

- **D-84 — Hard-structured boot and finalization response templates**
  (S45, architecture, SETTLED). Introduced the HARD-RULE response
  structures: Rule 2's exact boot response (session-name fence → rename
  directive → banner fence built from `banner_text` → opening statement →
  context status line) and Rule 11 Step 6's exact finalization response
  (widget → confirmation sentence → context status line). Eliminated
  Claude-side presentation drift; shipped as template v2.12.0 +
  `rules-session-end.md`. Rule 11 Step 6's widget consumption of
  `finalization_banner_html` is the surface deprecated by brief-439.
- **D-85 — Rule 9 context-status-line prominence boost** (S45,
  architecture, SETTLED). Added the ⛔ marker on Rule 9 and the standalone
  "Mandatory Response Closer" restatement section after observed compliance
  drift in instruction-dense projects (prose-style tier mentions substituted
  for the literal `[S{n} · Ex {n} · {emoji} ~{percent}%]` line, suppressing
  tier advisories and causing auto-compaction). Shipped as template v2.13.0.

## MCP template version history backfill (2.10.0 → 2.18.0)

`core-template-mcp.md` versions that were never logged (reconstructed from
`prism-framework` commit history). The framework's earlier changelog
backfill covered v2.2.0–v2.9.0 (S28 audit remediation); this closes the gap
to current.

| Version | Session | Change |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2.10.0 | S29 (+S35) | S29 audit remediation: **text banner (`banner_text`) replaces HTML in Rule 2** (ME-1), Rule 9 context-estimation update, session-end rules deferred to `prism_finalize` delivery. S35 added the candor-over-agreement Operating Posture bullet (D-74) without a version bump. |
| 2.11.0 | S44 | D-83: Rule 1 post-boot tool surface instruction — `tool_search` sweep after bootstrap + the banner's Tool Surface line. |
| 2.12.0 | S45 | **D-84**: hard-structured boot + finalization response templates (Rule 2 exact structure; Rule 11 Step 6 in `rules-session-end.md`). |
| 2.13.0 | S45 | **D-85**: Rule 9 prominence boost — ⛔ marker + Mandatory Response Closer restatement section. |
| 2.14.0 | S103 | D-190: CC Channel Discipline section — Trigger promoted to canonical channel for substantial Claude Code work; `cc_dispatch` retained for simple/small scope. |
| 2.15.0 | S106 | D-191 / brief-405: session-recommendation banner line — Rule 2 Block 3 renders the `Suggested:` line from `banner_text` position 4. |
| 2.16.0 | S107 | D-193 Pieces 4+1 / brief-411: concise-default Operating Posture bullet + persisted-recommendation note (finalize persists `recommended_session_settings` into handoff.md; bootstrap reads it back — closed the S107→S108 banner discrepancy). |
| 2.17.0 | S108 | D-193 Piece 2 / brief-412: Active model awareness Tier A rule — model/thinking/window self-report on the boot response + triage against the persisted recommendation. |
| 2.18.0 | S110 | D-196 Piece 3 / brief-416: stale-active surfacing paragraph — Trigger stuck-slot warning flows into the banner's `⚠` line. |

For context beyond the backfill range: v2.19.0 (D-227, window-aware Rule 9
context estimation) and v2.19.1 (Opus 4.8 added to the model-strength
ordering) are the currently deployed template versions and were logged in
their own commits.
